**About By The Numbers: In context of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta**

The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is part of the largest estuary on the west coast of North and South America. It supplies a portion of the water used by two-thirds of Californians; that’s more than 27 million people!

The Delta Stewardship Council was created in legislation to achieve the state mandated coequal goals for the Delta. "'Coequal goals' means the two goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Delta ecosystem. 

Therefore it is important to understand how water is changing and moving through our delta, and what that means for the watershed and the people and organisms that call it home.

**By The Numbers** provides Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta specific hydrologic information. The reported values are important areas and indicators for our Delta. These include precipitaiton, snow pack, Delta water exports, river flows, water temperature and reservoir information.
